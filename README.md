Takes the following parameters:
- Hole (list of the current two 'hole' cards the 'player' is has been dealt)
- Community (list of the currently dealt 'community' cards on the table, can be 0, 3, 4 or 5 cards)

Returns the following:
- A list of hand types and their corresponding probabilities, in order of strongest to weakest hands (note: will only display the strongest hand if 100% probability)

Run the Python file to execute the testing suite and the program.
